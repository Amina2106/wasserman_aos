I'm working through Larry Wasserman's "All of Statistics: A Concise Course in
Statistical Inference", as part of approaching machine learning from the
bottom-up.

The book has exercises without answers. I'm writing code to check my work, so
I can have some confidence I came up with the right solutions.
